# River and Reef Aquaculture LLC
This is an open-source e-commerce website Erin is building from scratch. She has been working on this since December 1, 2021.

She is currently about 5% complete. She still has a lot to do but is looking forward to the challenge.

This website is written in CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. It also uses SQL queries for the e-commerce part of the website (cart, account, etc. pages).
